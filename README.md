# Meetdata Proxy API

My friend Elias is into kiting .

I am not, but I am into cloud functions.

This is a simple cloud fn to simplify getting data from the open data at [Meetnet Vlaamse Banken](https://meetnetvlaamsebanken.be). By basing your API requests against our cloud function you can remove the need to create an account and including authorization headers in your HTTP request.

Endpoints are mirrored from [Meetnet's official API spec](https://api.meetnetvlaamsebanken.be/V2-help/)
